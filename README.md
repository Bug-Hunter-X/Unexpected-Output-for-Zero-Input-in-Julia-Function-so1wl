# Julia Function with Unexpected Output for Zero Input

This repository demonstrates a Julia function that produces unexpected output when the input is zero.

The function `my_function` is intended to square positive inputs and negate negative inputs. However, it returns 0 for a zero input. This is not usually an unexpected output. 

The solution shows how to modify the function to handle the zero input as expected.
